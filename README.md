# helpers

This repository contains a collection of some useful, but not necessarily related, Python scripts that carry out or accelerate various tasks, most of which involve dark matter simulations.

In particular, you can find Pyhton scripts that

- load the Gadget-2 snapshots,
- load the ascii outputs from Peter Behroozi's Rockstar and Consistent Trees,
- caluclate projected correlation functions with error estimation from jackknife,

and many more other things!
